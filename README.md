Scripts for managing DISCS services at LNLS/Sirius

- a driving bash script 'discs-run.sh' to backup services databases, clone repositories, etc.
- a readme file 'dics-readme.txt' with a short and handy compilation of a selection of common instructions, such as how to start/stop services, use REST interface to consume data and so on.
- excel files used to upload data to the services databases.
